# FireAndManeuver
Full Thrust rules "plugin" for abstract movement - no tabletop, no minis, no measuring. Optimized for PbEM and automation.

[Current DRAFT ruleset is here](Ruleset-FireAndManeuver.md). Consider this "pre-alpha" with both layout and the rules themselves still in a great degree of flux. Note that we're trying to adhere to the CommonMark spec here, mostly so we can edit in VSCode with usable previews.

Scripting and automation for running Full Thrust battles using the Fire and Maneuver ruleset is... in the planning stages.
